<!-- <h1 class="post-title">remembering the forest vs. the trees</h1> -->

	<!-- <span class="post-date">Sun 22 July 2018</span> -->
	<p>Have you ever been in a relationship, where early on you are wearing rose colored glasses. Everything is great, he is the best, life is good. But, maybe you were overlooking some red flags or some idiosyncrasies in his behavior that turned out to really bug you later on. After a few months of bliss, it all fell apart and you broke up. Now, when you look back and reflect on that past failed relationship, you only really only remember the things you hated. Like how he would snore really loudly at night, or always forget to fill up the brita with water. Just the major deal breakers.</p>
<p>In this example, the context shifted. When you were in the relationship initially, you were  happy and in love and really only focused on the positive outlook and overview of the relationship, As things soured, you started focusing on the details, and only saw traits that were a major turn off.</p>
<h3>background</h3>
<p>It turns out there is a relationship between emotion and how people pay attention to and remember information. Positive emotions cause people to focus on the big picture, or, ‘see the forest instead of the trees’. Whereas negative emotion causes people to focus on the trees, without really noticing the forest.</p>
<p>A previous study showed that the mood of participants influences whether they pay attention to the forest or the trees. In this study, the authors used modified Navon figures, which are big shapes made up of little shapes. Subjects saw a shape on top of the screen (a big triangle made of small squares) that served as a cue. On the bottom of the screen, they saw two related shapes were prompted to choose the image that was most similar to the cue. Before subjects completed the task, however, they were instructed to write about either a positive experience or a negative experience from their past. Thinking and writing about a positive or negative event was enough to alter the mood of the participants. Interestingly, subjects who wrote about a positive experience were more likely to choose the object that was similar on the global level (the big triangle made of little squares), whereas subjects who wrote about a negative experience were more likely to focus on the local features (they chose the object made of little triangles). This study suggested that mood influences what information we attend to.</p>
<p><img alt="fig1" src="/images/shapes_mood.jpg"></p>
<h3>emotion influences memory</h3>
<p>These findings prompted me to study this phenomenon in a memory setting. I was interested in how emotion not only influences what we pay attention to, but also what we later remember about an experience or event.</p>
<p>I had to change a few key aspects of the prior attention study to investigate this phenomenon in a memory setting. First of all, I had to change the actual stimuli, because generic shapes made of other little shapes are not particularly memorable -- nor are they very realistic. But, local vs. global processing or seeing the forest or the trees is a real phenomenon that can govern our attentional processing and memory.</p>
<p>I changed the to-be-remembered information to something we are all extremely familiar with: faces. Faces have both holistic or global information and local/featural information, making them perfect to study memory for local vs. global information. The holistic information is the stereotyped relationship between all of features. The eyes are above the nose, which is above the mouth, etc. We process this holistic information fluidly and expertly, as we are highly skilled at viewing faces (I don’t know about you, but I’ve been honing this expertise since I was a baby!). We also can process the local or featural information about faces. I’m sure you can remember someone’s striking blue eyes or big crooked nose very vividly. But, we do rely more heavily on holistic information to process faces. One way to disrupt the holistic processing that we normally rely on to recognize people, is to flip a face upside down. To recognize an upside down face, we rely solely on the features.</p>
<p><img alt="fig2" src="/images/thatcher.png"></p>
<p>The second feature I changed was the mood induction. Rather than having subjects write about an irrelevant past experience that was positive or negative, I tailored stories to be directly relevant to the faces participants studied for the memory test. In this way I harnessed the power of association to create positive vs. negative emotions related to specific faces. I wrote a bunch of happy and sad vignettes. I had participants read a vignette just before they would see a face, which was the protagonist of the short description.</p>
<p><img alt="fig3" src="/images/face_task.png"></p>
<p>Later, I tested participants’ memory for the faces, by showing them a bunch of faces they’d seen before mixed with an equal number of brand new faces. Participants always studied the faces right-side up. However, at the test, they saw the face presented either right-side up or upside-down, and the vignette was not re-presented. Remarkably, I found that faces that had previously been associated with a happy story were remembered better than faces associated with a sad story when I tested memory for the faces in the upright position. On the other hand, memory for the upside down faces benefited when the faces had been associated with a sad story rather than a happy story. These results suggest that happy associations cause participants to attend to and remember holistic/global information whereas sad associations cause participants to attend to and remember featural/local information.</p>

<h3>where does this study fall on the implicit-explicit continuum?</h3>
<p>In this task, subjects had to overtly make a behavioral response about whether they saw a face before or not. The main measure of memory I used was Explicit. However, I would argue that the influence of emotion on how subjects processed the faces was implicit. Subjects were not aware that they attended to more “local” features of Sad faces and more “global” features of happy faces. However, they likely viewed the faces differently when they studied them (sadly I did not have access to an eye tracker at the time of this experiment), which caused them to remember them differently on the final test.</p>
<h3>extrapolation &amp; speculation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even though content you are presenting may not have any inherent positive or negative valence, the person you present it to might still have positive or negative associations with a topic that you consider neutral (e.g. memory of college for one person could be filled with happy nostalgia, whereas memory of college for another person could be encompassed by debilitating student debt).</li>
<li>When presenting emotional material, you might have to adjust content so that the right level of details vs. overarching ideas get across the way you want them to.</li>
