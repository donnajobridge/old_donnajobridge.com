Summary:

You’ve probably heard the eyes are the window to the soul, but I would say that the eyes are the window to the brain. The eyes provide so much information about what a person might be thinking or feeling, whether they are an expert or a novice, and even if they will later remember whatever it is they’re viewing.

You might think that our eyes are mainly governed by perception -- something flashy catches our attention and we look there (think of a cat with chasing around a laser pointer). Or, you detect some movement in the periphery and you search around looking for the culprit (a spider, gahh!). It is indeed the case that changes in lighting and movement can guide our viewing behavior. But, our memory is also a powerful influence on what we look at. This has been a major focus of my research.

###background
Eye movements are at the cusp of unconscious vs. conscious processing in the brain. We move our eyes to distinct locations around 3-5 times per second. This rapid eye movement behavior can reveal real-time information about what we are thinking before we even have time to overtly verbalize it or make a voluntary response. For instance, imagine seeing a friend after a few months. She looks like your same old friend -- but there is something different. You ask, have you lost weight? Did you get a tan? And then you finally realize, she has a new haircut! Even though it may have taken you a few moments to consciously realize the change in hairstyle, your eyes were probably quick to detect the difference. Without your knowledge you may have looked at her hair several times before you consciously realized that it was different. In fact, this behavior is probably what gave you that vague feeling that *something* had changed, even though you hadn’t quite put your finger on what it was. In this scenario, the memory of your old friend guided your eye movement to the changed feature (the haircut), and then your conscious awareness caught up.

This simple example of detecting a difference about your friend highlights two key aspects of memory I’m most interested in: remembering familiar information and detecting new information. We are able to access existing memories and detect differences in the environment so rapidly that it feels like they must occur simultaneously. In fact, prior research has been unable to really pull apart these processes because we have lacked the tools to identify them in real time. In a normal experiment where a subject is asked to determine if an image is identical to one they have seen before or if it has any differences, subjects will look around for a few seconds and then make a single button press at the end of a predetermined period indicating their choice. But as I mentioned in the Introduction, there are many steps involved that lead up to that final behavioral response. First you look around and scan the image. Detect any features that are familiar or distinct. Then, compare what you are looking at to your internal representation. Determine if there are any differences and then finally press a button indicating your response.

To really capture how our brain processes information that leads up to a behavioral response, I use eye movements. I pioneered a new approach to track memory processing as it unfolds rapidly over the time by using eye movements. The way I did this was by combining individual eye movements with neural recordings obtained from electrodes implanted deep into the brain of epilepsy patients. These patients have electrodes implanted deep into their brains temporarily so that doctors can monitor their seizures in an attempt to identify the source of their epileptic activity. As a researcher, I was able to gain access to these patients in the hospital while they weren’t doing clinical testing. I asked them to perform a memory test while i tracked their eye movements with a special camera.

###research design
I designed a special memory task to differentiate remembering information from detecting new information using eye movements. In the memory task, I inferred that remembering old information would be reflected by eye movements directed to familiar content, whereas identifying new information would be reflected by eye movements directed to unfamiliar content. Using this technique, I was able to pull apart how these processes operate independently and interact on rapid time scales.

###main Points
* Eye movements are at the cusp of conscious vs. unconscious awareness
* Eye movements reveal what people are thinking and how the brain is processing information
* Designing specific tasks are required in order to harness the power of eye movements


###extrapolation
* Eye movements can be harnessed to gain insight into how people learn, what people like, what people pay attention to and what they later remember
* Eye movements provide a rich data set that can be combined with other measures (feedback, responses)
* Eyes might repeatedly dart to where you’re hiding the drugs
* Encountering interfaces, where do people expect a button or menu to be
