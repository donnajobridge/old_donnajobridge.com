<h2>donna j. bridge, ph.d.</h2>
<p>

I am a professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. In my free time, I practice yoga in a hot room while waving around weights (it's actually a lot of fun), cook vegetarian food, and play board games with my husband. I also enjoy self-reflecting and thinking about life.
