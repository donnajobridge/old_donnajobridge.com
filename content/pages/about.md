Summary:
I've spent the past 10 years researching the brain and how
people learn and remember. I also spend a lot of time self-reflecting and thinking
about life. Outside of work, I like to do yoga in a hot room while
waving around weights (it's actually a lot of fun), visit local farmers markets,
cook vegetarian food and bake pies, ride my bike, drink hoppy beer,
travel, and playing board games with my husband.
