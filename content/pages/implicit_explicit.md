###neural processing
At the bottom of the Implicit - Explicit continuum is neural processing. Our brain is working nonstop behind the scenes, and we don’t have much knowledge about what it’s doing and when it’s doing it. Given the rapid processing speed of our brains, it’s not surprising we can’t keep up with it. I measure brain activity using a number of different techniques to determine how our brain processes information during learning and remembering. One technique is called fMRI, which measures blood flow. When we use a part of our brain in a certain task, oxygenated blood flows to that region. However, blood flow changes (10-15 seconds) are very slow compared to brain activity (tens of milliseconds), so we are unable to get precise timing about when the brain acts in response to a stimulus. The main advantage of this technique is that we are able to get great spatial resolution about where the activity happens.

Another technique I use for studying brain activity is called EEG (electrocorticography), which measures electrical activity in the brain. The primary benefit of this technique is that it has highly precise temporal resolution -- we are able to detect changes in electrical activity on the millisecond time scale. This technique comes in multiple forms. The most common type is called scalp EEG. This involves testing normal healthy participants and is completely non-invasive. We put what looks like a shower cap with holes on participants’ heads and load up the holes with conductive gel. We then insert electrodes into the cap holes. These scalp electrodes measure electrical activity emanating from the brain. Our brains produce a lot of electricity and we are able to detect it using this technique. The main problem is we aren’t sure where the activity comes from (but plenty of researchers have implemented different modeling approaches to localize the source of the neural activity). The second major problem is that we have muscles on our head (close to our temple, around our eyes, etc.), and these muscles also produce a lot of electrical activity that bleeds into the signal we are recording from the scalp. It’s difficult to separate the signal from the noise. To get around this problem, we have participants relax as much as possible, and importantly, we ask them to keep their eyes still during testing (basically they have to stare at the screen without blinking).

For someone with a keen interest in eye movements, scalp EEG presents a lot of problems. To cope with this issue, I began doing intracranial EEG. This technique also involves recording electrical activity from the brain -- the electrodes are implanted directly into the brain rather than lying on the outer scalp. To do this research, I work with epilepsy patients who have these electrodes implanted for clinical purposes. This technique has the best of both worlds, high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The downside is that patients are very rare and their brains may be slightly dysfunctional due to epilepsy.

###eye movements
Next up on the continuum is eye movements. Eye movements occur rapidly -- we make 3 to 5 distinct eye movements per second. I would be willing to bet that you are only consciously aware of a subset of the eye movements you make. Because they occur so fast, you don’t have the chance to overtly decide what every single eye movement is going to be -- they occur almost automatically. This is because different processes (e.g. perception, attention, and memory) can dictate what we look at and when, without us really being aware of it. For example, imagine a small child did something wrong -- he broke the cookie jar. To cover up his mistake, he crudely hid it behind a chair. You ask, what happened to the cookie jar? He doesn’t answer, but you know immediately by his gaze where the cookie jar remnants are. The child doesn’t want to give away that information, but his eyes couldn’t help but look at the evidence.

Of course we also move our eyes deliberately to certain locations, for instance when we are trying to pay attention to someone talking or when we are searching the room for our keys. The main point is that eye movements can be governed by both conscious and unconscious forces. They can provide rich information about what a person might be thinking on a rapid time scale by revealing the evolution of our thoughts over a period of time. In the eye movement section, I talk more about eye movements and how they can be used to deepen our understanding of the brain and human behavior.

###behavior
The next step in the continuum is behavior. The specific type of behavior I’m talking about is what cognitive neuroscientists typically measure to link up cognition (or thinking) to neural activity. For instance, in a standard memory task, subjects will be asked to memorize a list of 12 unrelated words. After a delay, subjects are prompted to recite as many words from the list as they can remember. This recitation of words from memory is a typical behavior that is measured in memory experiments. Another example of a behavior that is measured is pressing a button on the keyboard or clicking the mouse when a word appears that participants saw before.

This type of behavioral response gives reasonably good information about the content of people’s memory. However, it is lacking in a few ways. Let’s say you study a set of unique photographs. For the test, I present twice as many photographs: half of which you’ve seen before and half of which are brand new to you. When you see a photograph you have to make a response about whether you saw it before or not. It might take you a couple of seconds to make a response. We now have a marker of memory for that event. However, when you first saw the photograph, you scanned the picture to find any features that were familiar to you. Then, you searched your memory for any matches. Then, you made a decision about how confident you are that you saw that picture before. And finally, you began planning a motor response and initiated the movement of your finger to press the appropriate button. When we simply measure the final response, we are unable to capture that dynamic processing that led up to the behavior. Nonetheless, it does provide some useful information, and is prevalently used in the field.

###feedback
The final step in the continuum is feedback. Primarily, I’ve used feedback from participants when I’m trying out a new experiment and working out the kinks. After they complete a task, I’ll sit down with the participants and ask them their thoughts on the task. What strategy did they use? Did it feel too hard? Was there anything peculiar about the stimuli? Getting direct feedback from the participants saves a lot of time when I’m designing new experiments. You don’t want to end up with an experiment with some glaring errors that were readily detected by the participants. Also, people are pretty perceptive, so it’s useful to take advantage of their thoughts to improve your design and your understanding of the effects you see in the data.
