##Research Design
A fundamental problem with recordings of brain activity is that without additional context, we don't really know what it means. (Hmm, this area seems more active than that one right now, but what is the patient doing to cause this?).

To understand what specific brain activity means, we have to link it to some kind of behavioral metric. We design tests that hone on really specific cognitive processes -- like remembering a specific detail or adding two numbers (see future post on designing experiments). Experimental design, alone, however, can't pull apart the sequence of events that happen on each trial. This is because each trial lasts a few seconds, whereas our processes information within milliseconds.

To parse really fast sequences of brain activity we need a behavioral metric that gets close to matching it.

###main points
* Designing specific tasks are required in order to harness the power of eye movements
* by combining the right set of tools we can answer questions that were previously inaccessible.
