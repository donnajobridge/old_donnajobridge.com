Summary:

Individual vs. team member - team member gets put into soccer game, has individual stats, but also affects all other team members

In most cases, it’s not helpful to actually think about the brain as if it were a computer. They seem to operate much differently. For instance, a computer is really good at crunching tons of numbers iteratively and efficiently to extract patterns. Humans can extract patterns implicitly, but we don’t do this by going through each iteration of every possible combination. However, I think the long-term memory storage vs. RAM (short-term Memory storage) is a pretty good analogy for the way active vs. inactive memory works in humans.

The idea of active vs. inactive memory is relatively simple. We have accumulated vast amounts of information over our lifetime, but we don’t need to have instantaneous access to all of it all of the time. So, our brains can efficiently store this information and gain access to it when we receive some kind of input or cue that queues the memory up. When this happens, we can think of that memory as going into ‘active storage’ so we can use it to make decisions and guide our behavior.


Context
Queueing up a memory has a number of ramifications on behavior and later memory. One well-known finding is called the testing effect. This effect shows that when people are forced to recall information, memory is substantially better than simply restuding the information. This is especially useful when learning content, such as learning a new language. Creating mini-tests during learning (What is the english word for Gehirn?) yields better long-term retention compared to simply restudying the association over and over again (Gehirn means brain).

Most research about memory treats it like it is a stable copy of an event that we experienced. A lot of my research has focused on how this is not the case, it’s actually a lot more messy.


My Stuff
My research has gone beyond investigating how our memory improves by testing it. Instead, I’ve focused on how we dynamically use our memory to guide our behavior and influence how we learn new information and form new associations.

For example, my research has shown that we are much better at remembering retrieved content over restudied content -- even when the retrieved content is wrong! “I remember Peter wearing a blue hat!” is going to be much more memorable than evening seeing Peter wearing a red hat again! Second, recalling a memory enables us to learn new content quickly and incorporate it into that existing memory representation or schema. Creating associations between new content and stuff we already know helps us learn very quickly. Third, recalling a memory influences how and what we pay attention to. We focus on content that is new, which promotes the integration of that information into our recalled memory.

Main Points
Accessing specific memories guides our behavior, determines what we pay attention to
Recalling information promotes later memory for the information over and above restudying it
Recalling information allows integration of new content into that memory.


Extrapolation
When you are learning new content, give yourself little tests to promote rapid learning
Try to form associations between new content and concepts you already know that seem similar or related
Get people to actively engage with content, rather than passively use content (for example, have people make choices, fill in the blank with missing information, generate answers rather than instructing people to press certain buttons, or read content).

Conclusion
Actively using memory is extremely powerful tool to learn new information. It enhances attention, and promotes rapid integration of new content into our existing frameworks.
