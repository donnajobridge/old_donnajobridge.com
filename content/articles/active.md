Summary: actively using memory to enhance learning

When you consider a team sport, like soccer, individual players like Messi are sure to come to mind. But, when it comes down to it, winning is a team sport. Even though every team might have one or two all-star players, those individuals are not winning the games by themselves. Instead, when they play, they influence activity on the entire field. Every action one player takes affects where the other team members run, who they block, or when they pass the ball.

###memory is not an island
Memory is a team sport too. Our brains aren't filled with a bunch of isolated facts. One thing that makes us so intelligent is our ability to make connections among seemingly unrelated pieces of information. This is the heart of memory. At the same time, we don't form associations between every piece of content we encounter. Our brains are relatively selective at deciding what gets gelled together. How does it do that?

One idea is that we have both "active" and "inactive" memories at any given time. We have accumulated vast amounts of information over our lifetime, but we donâ€™t need to have instantaneous access to all of it all of the time. Just imagine how confusing that would be -- we wouldn't be able to function! So, our brains can efficiently store this information and gain access to it when we receive some kind of trigger that queues up the memory. When this happens, we can think of that memory as being "activated" so we can use it to make decisions and guide our behavior.


###testing accelerates learning
'once you stop learning you start dying'
-- albert einstein

At some point in your life, you were probably used to getting tested regularly. Once you finally graduated, you didn't have tests constantly looming over you anymore, but that doesn't mean you stopped learning new facts and skills. Whether its learning how to use a new app or speak a foreign language, effective learning strategies are highly valuable. There are so many great tools out there to teach people new skills. Web-based programs like Duolingo and DataCamp are popular tools that drill language and computing concepts. What makes these tools so effective?

These web-based programs emphasize one thing: active engagement. Rather than simply reading material and repeating it over and over until its drilled into your head, effective learning programs get you to actively engage in the material. This active engagement can be memory retrieval, which involves actively remembering some specific content you studied. Or, it can ask you to creatively apply concepts to new situations. Both of these approaches require you to employ some agency during the learning process. This agency during learning involves voluntarily remembering specific content, making a choice, or combining information in a way that creates something new.

###how does actively remembering influence behavior?
I have investigated how actively remembering a specific event influences how we engage with other content in the environment. This research has focused on how we dynamically use memory to guide our behavior and influence how we learn new information.

The idea is just like the soccer player analogy from above. How does moving a soccer player off the bench and onto the field influence the entire team dynamics?

##remembering promotes learning
I tested the idea that remembering a specific event would help people learn other information more efficiently. The trick was making the other information totally irrelevant to the remembered event and getting subjects to encounter the other content immediately after remembering.

For this task, subjects studied object-location associations. After a delay, subjects engaged in an active or passive condition. In the active condition, I asked subjects to remember each object's location and move it to that spot on the screen. In the passive condition, I asked subjects to simply move the object to a yellow box on the screen. In the active condition, subjects had to voluntarily bring the object's location to mind. On the other hand, in the passive condition, subjects did not have any agency to decide where to place the object. Immediately after the subject moved the object, they encountered the face.

Later, I tested subjects' memory of the faces. The hypothesis was that subjects would remember faces better if they encountered them right after they *actively remembered* an object's location rather than right after they *passively moved* an object to a location.

Interestingly we found just that. Memory was better when they encountered the faces immediately after actively remembering an unrelated object. [(Bridge, 2014)](/pdfs/bridge14nsy.pdf){:target="_blank"}

I hypothesized that actively remembering a specific event produces an active brain state, that makes learning easier. To test this idea, we also recorded brain activity while subjects studied the faces using scalp EEG. With this data, I could see if brain activity differed when subjects studied faces in the active vs. the passive condition.

The EEG data looked remarkably different in the two conditions. These data confirmed the idea that actively remembering a specific event changes the current brain state, making it an ideal time to learn new content. These results suggest that actively remembering specific events creates an active brain state that promotes learning.

###Main Points
* Actively remembering produces a unique brain state, making it ideal to learn to content quickly and efficiently
* Actively remembering specific memories influences our behavior, determines what we pay attention to

###Conclusion
Actively using memory is extremely powerful tool to learn new information. It enhances attention, and promotes rapid integration of new content into our existing frameworks.

<!-- ###active remembering influences what we look at
Because I used scalp EEG in this study, I was unable to record eye movements effectively. This is because scalp EEG records electrical activity emanating from the head, which is a combination of both brain activity and muscle activity. Unfortunately, muscles around our eyes produce a lot of noise in the data when we blink or look around freely, making it difficult to separate the signal from the noise. So, in the face task, I had to ask subjects to maintain a static fixation while they studied the faces.

However, since I found that actively remembering an event promotes learning, I wondered if the active brain state would also influence how we *engage* other content. Specifically, how do we visually explore other information in the environment when we're in an active vs. a passive state?

To study this, I modified the task design so that it was suitable to examine eye movements. The goal of this study was to see how actively remembering one piece of information influences how we visually explore other content.

In this task, subjects studied 3 objects on a grid. Each object was shown in a unique location. After a delay, I prompted subjects to move one object to its associated location. In an active condition, subjects had to remember where the object had previously been shown and move it to that location. In a passive condition, subjects simply moved the object to its location, which was indicated by a yellow box. After subjects moved the object back to its location, they had the opportunity to restudy all three objects. Later I tested their memory for the objects and their associations.

I recorded eye movements both before and after subjects moved the object in the active or passive condition. This way, I could see how actively remembering one object influenced how subjects viewed the other objects. -->








<!-- ####real world applications
When you are learning new content, give yourself little tests to promote rapid learning
Try to form associations between new content and concepts you already know that seem similar or related
Get people to actively engage with content, rather than passively use content (for example, have people make choices, fill in the blank with missing information, generate answers rather than instructing people to press certain buttons, or read content). -->
